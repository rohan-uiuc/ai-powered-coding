  // Base prompt
  const basePrompt = `We are embarking on an ambitious project to develop a cloud-native data management framework called Clowder designed to support any research domain. The goal is to create a scalable data repository that enables researchers and scientists in data-intensive fields to share, organize, and analyze data efficiently. The system is intended to manage raw data, complex metadata, and support automatic data pipelines. Importantly, this is not a centralized system; rather, it is software that research labs and individual users can deploy on local clusters or in cloud environments.

Key aspects of the project include:
	1.	Data Agnosticism & Customization:
	•	The repository should handle various data types out-of-the-box while being highly customizable for specific data types.
	•	Implement a sophisticated information extraction bus that can flexibly ingest and process data according to user-defined rules.
	•	Support custom web-based visualization plugins to render and interact with data dynamically.
	2.	Community-Driven & Collaborative:
	•	Beyond being a tool, the platform should foster a community of practitioners working on data-intensive research projects, promoting cross-domain tool development and knowledge sharing.
	•	Incorporate community contributions and feedback loops into the system's evolution.
	3.	Modern Web Interface:
	•	The front end must be built using shadcn UI components to deliver a clean, modern, and responsive interface that end users find intuitive and powerful.
	•	Design for high usability, accessibility, and responsiveness, ensuring that the system can handle large volumes of data and complex metadata visualizations.
	4.	Maintainable Codebase:
	•	Emphasize an architecture that is easy to pick up, extend, and maintain.
	•	Adhere to best practices in modular design, component reuse, and clear documentation to allow rapid development and onboarding of new contributors.
	5.	Scalability & Cloud-Native Principles:
	•	Architect the solution to scale seamlessly from local clusters to cloud deployments.
	•	Leverage cloud-native design patterns (such as microservices or containerization) to ensure robustness, scalability, and ease of deployment.

Your Task:
Provide an in-depth strategy for designing the UI and overall system architecture, focusing on the following points:
	•	UI/UX Design:
	•	How can we leverage shadcn's component library to create a cohesive, modern, and responsive UI for data management and visualization?
	•	Which specific UI patterns or components would best support the handling of large datasets and intricate metadata structures?
	•	What design considerations should we incorporate to facilitate the development and integration of custom visualization plugins?
	•	Scalability & Maintainability:
	•	Outline strategies to ensure that the codebase remains modular and maintainable as the system scales.
	•	Suggest architectural patterns that align with cloud-native principles, including containerization, microservices, or serverless functions, to support dynamic deployment environments.
	•	Integration & Customization:
	•	How might the system's information extraction bus be architected to accommodate various data formats and processing rules?
	•	Recommend approaches for integrating third-party tools or community-contributed modules seamlessly into the platform.
	•	Community and Collaboration:
	•	Provide ideas for features or design elements that can foster a collaborative community around this platform, such as shared workspaces, version-controlled data pipelines, or plugin marketplaces.

Please include detailed recommendations, design mockups if applicable, and any relevant references or best practices from current literature or industry standards. Your insights should help us create a modernized, user-friendly interface and a robust, scalable framework that can serve the evolving needs of data-intensive research communities.`;
